# real_time_face_recognition
Developed utilizing OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Implemented the Haar Cascade classifier to detect and extract facial features from images and video streams in real time.
Utilized the KNN algorithm to establish a recognition model based on captured facial data.
Captures and stores facial data locally.
Loads data for predictions, achieving real-time recognition.
