# real_time_face_recognition
Developed utilizing OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Implemented the Haar Cascade classifier to detect and extract facial features from images and video streams in real time.
Captures and stores facial data locally.
Loads data for predictions, achieving real-time recognition.
